# Project-Miskatonic

>  A game engine for TRPG Games.  
>  Based on Python 3

This is a gaming engine that is designed to run TRPG games. The Engine itself is modular designed, allow both the developers and the keepers to modify the game for whatever they want.  
The name of this repo is after The Miskatonic University, a fictional university from Cthulhu Mythos which is well-know for its occult collections and research teams.

## Background

People play TRPGs a lot. But I believe that a big problem for TRPG gamers is that they can't enjoy the game without enough people. So I want to write something to allow gamers like me who can't find friends with time or interest to enjoy TRPG.

## Install

Most Python libs I use came with Python package. Just install Python 3 and git clone this repo and you're good to go.  
Please be aware that certain game pack may contain Python libs that *doesn't* come with standard Python package. If such thing happened, please just install the lib or contact with the developer of the game pack for support.

## Usage

I'm not sure yet how this engine will work so let it go first.

### Make your own pack

To make your own game pack, please pack all the files your game need and release the archive file with another README.

## Maintainers 

This engine's main maintainer is PegionFish.

## Contributing

I'm 100%  welcome to anyone who wants to join the project and make some contrubite.

## License

This project is released under MIT protocol.  
But I'm planning a protocol for some special needs and this will change in future if everything goes right.
