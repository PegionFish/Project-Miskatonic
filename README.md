## Background

People play TRPGs a lot. But I believe that a big problem for TRPG gamers is that they can't enjoy the game without enough people. So I want to write something to allow gamers like me who can't find friends with time or interest to enjoy TRPG.

## Install

Most Python libs I use came with Python package. Just install Python 3 and git clone this repo and you're good to go.  
Please be aware that certain game pack may contain Python libs that *doesn't* come with standard Python package. If such thing happened, please just install the lib or contact with the developer of the game pack for support.

## Usage

The gameplay files are located in your repository folder. Just download the game pack you found online and copy everything to the folder that fits. Then, just run the main.py file and enjoy the game.

### Make your own pack

To make your own game pack, please pack all the files your game need and release the archive file with another README.

## Maintainers 

This engine's main maintainer is Bob Guo.

## Contributing

I'm 100%  welcome to anyone who wants to join the project and make some contrubite.
