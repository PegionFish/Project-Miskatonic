For the brave souls who have come here:
    You are the hero, you are the chosen ones, you are the valiant knights of programming, you are the detection who bravely face the Old Ones, you are BJ who led the 2nd US Revolution. You are Shintaro from kagerou_project, you are the true gamechanger.
    To these brave souls I say this:
        never gonna give you up
        never gonna let you down
        never gonna run around and desert you
        never gonna make you cry
        never gonna say goodbye
        never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
Happy modifying and debugging guys~
From Bob
