# Dev Memo
## First batch of module
Try to write a module of throwing dice and count time, start at 13th May. I will make note about everything I wrote.
## Another guide //COMPLETED
I will write an article about the basics of a CoC Player file in this engine at 12th May.
And I will devorce English version of guide from Chinese ones. I personally believe that this makes the document more user-friendly. Besides, my English level sucks for sure.
