## What is PC
PC, or Player Character, is player's avatar in the TRPG world. A PC file can be used in different games when the player and the KP swaps the data via a specified rules. In this document, I will use CoC V7 Rulebook to show how to do so.

## The request of a PC
In CoC V7 Rulebook, a standard PC should have following parts:
1. Basic information
2. Attribute
3. Skill
4. Equipment
5. Asset
6. Background  

In this project, KP or player should prepare their card with all parts except No.5 and No.6(Due to use them in this project request NLP modules to involve). Please do notice that your PC's charactor\weapons\equipments would be different when the date of the game have changed. In the traditional CoC rules, there are only 20s and Modern era, but using third-party addons may offer more opitions. About addons' offering you should directly ask the developer of that addon to get more information. In the engine's Github folder, I will prepare a demo PC with no informations about No.5 and No.6, but the data would be strange so this PC is not recommended to play with.
## PC in this project
In this project, your PC file also works as your saving(Although you COULD make a new PC for every game and the fact that keeping the PC is usually more widely used in series games). After your game ends, the system will automaticlly edit related parts of the PC file(e.g when your charactor lost his/her reputation, the PC file's Credit Rating part would be cutted).When your PC died in game, you can decide whether to delete this PC and make another. Some data in this file(e,g the list of games you have been with this PC) may be used in games.
